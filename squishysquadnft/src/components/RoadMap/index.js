								significantly help families in Hawaii facing the financial and
								emotional hardships of caring for a seriously ill child. For 39
								years, HUGS has served Hawaii children, ages birth to 21,
								diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses ranging from cancer,
								cardia issues, liver and kidney ailments, and chromosomal
								defects. The founding team was born and raised in the beautiful
								state of Hawaii and would love for our community to come
								together and support these challenged families. We also look
								forward to giving back to other charities and hosting charitable
								events in the future!
